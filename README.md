# 30-Day Pandas Study Plan

## üìÖ Overview
This is a **30-day study plan** focused on mastering **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. The goal is to complete a structured learning path covering real-world dataset handling and LeetCode-style coding problems.

## üìö Learning Objectives
- Understand Pandas DataFrames and Series
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Implement data aggregation and grouping
- Apply filtering, merging, and joining techniques
- Work with time-series and multi-index data
- Optimize performance using vectorized operations
